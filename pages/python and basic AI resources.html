            <h2>Python Programming Resources </h2>
            <p>
                Python is a highly versatile language widely used in AI and data science. 
                You are advised to learn the basics fast and spend more time on learning various modules
                like pandas, numpy, sci-py, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, no matter how many books of cooking you read, you'll never become a chef until your first stew. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Do learn from videos and books, but most importantly set up your preferred environment and get busy actually 
                coding.

                a site wherein they teach you python from complete scratch. You may want to learn the basics from here

                <li><a href="https://www.python.org/doc/" target="_blank">Official Python Documentation</a> Always refer to 
                the official documentation of any modules you find difficult. This way you learn a few more things compared to 
                just asking the exact thing to chatGPT or your friends.</li>

            <p>
                Ideally you should be following just a few good resources consistently to cover the basics. I shall 
                refrain from this being a huge cumbersome list of videos/books which will make it harder for you to go through 
                before the hackathon. Instead I shall provide a good starting point, and expect the audience to be curious
                enough to search more and more as needed (through tools like Google and chatGPT).

                       YT Video from freecodecamp on ML </a> This video explains many different fundamental concepts and I found it
                   quite helpful in learning the basics. Note there might be times where you don't understand certain aspects. I encourage 
                   viewers to just pause the video and Google/ChatGPT your way to solving your doubts immediately without them piling up.

                       Data science from Scratch: First principles with Python</a> This book is AMAZING. You shall find everything fundamental, from a crash course

                   go-to book for learning the basics. Having said that, try and refrain from bombarding your brain with too much info. Read and learn basics, but try not to 
                   go into details before having learnt the underlying math with a level of proficiency.

            <h2>Additional Resources - ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from learning through sites and books and videos, there is equal (if not more) scope for learning through quick searches on LLM's like ChatGPT, 
                or simply Googling (a smarter version is Perplexity, which I find myself using more often). Although, this has certain good ways to learn and certain bad ways 
                to learn from such online automated resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    How and How NOT to use ChatGPT (and Google, Perplexity, etc.):
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                ChatGPT (an online free-to-use LLM) is a great tool to learn many different things, and it should be; considering it was trained on, essentially, the entire Internet. For effective learning, 
                however (especially to learn Python, AI), Users shouldn't simply search for the answer to a specific question and copy paste it to their assignments/code environments.
                There must be active learning involved. A good learner should always first read and try to understand the answer, replicate it him/herself, and ask ChatGPT to judge 
                their replication iteratively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as coding is concerned, always ask the LLM to use lots of comments/explanations to enhance the learning of the user. Sure, when you're working on a deadline, you might want to
                skip learning. But whilst learning, always focus on YOUR learning, instead of providing answers to a question mindlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When to use LLM's?
            </p>
            <p>
                Use LLM's only after first searching on existing work. You'll always find help online through sites like reddit, quora, stack exchange and github.
                This isn't to say that you should use LLM's as a last resort. You should side-by-side try to extrapolate ideas from the afore-mentioned sites using LLM's
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, ChatGPT isn't just available to you. It is open to everyone. Don't slow the process of your learning to just abide by the standards of learning 
                set by the so called experts and professionals. If you can learn ideas, replicate work and recall concepts, you 'know' the subject. It doesn't matter which path you take -
                LLM's or Books/Videos.
