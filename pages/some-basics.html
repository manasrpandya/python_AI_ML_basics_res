            <b>What is a hackathon?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
         In the context of AI, a hackathon typically involves a <u>dataset</u> and a <u>problem statement</u>, using which the competitiors
            define AI models. The competitors are given a set period of time, wherein they create various AI models. The prediction
            of these models are compared with the actual data in the hands of organisers, to display <u>errors/accuracy</u>. 
        </p>
    <p>
These errors/accuracies are then used to sort the competitors in a <u>Leaderboard</u>. At the end of the hackathon, the competitors at 
        the top positions are awarded accordingly. 
    </p>
        <p>
            The platform we will use for our hackathon is kaggle. And in fact, many popular hackathons related to AI/ML
            take place here. A good place to start is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-kaggle" > This Notebook</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Why should you participate in a hackathon?</b> 
        </p>
        <p> 
            A hackathon is the closest thing to real life projects apart from, well real life itself. Sure the prelimnary
            hackathons like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic" > Titanic (Kaggle)</a> and this, the Hackathon Uno
            are very static and there aren't many new things to learn after you learn the best solution(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            But in more serious hackathons, where new solutions are required and a 'perfect solution' doesn't exist, 
            The competitors get to learn a lot more than just various models and how they function, like context of various 
            models, which model is appropriate, etc.
        </p>
  

        <p>
            <b>How does the Hackathon Uno help with learning AI/ML?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
           Hackathon Uno is designed not for you to specialize in AI/ML. Assuming you are in the DSAI degree, that 
            will be taught to you anyways. The Hackathon has rather been designed to get you familiarized with
            AI/ML concepts with high-level usage of various concepts, readying you for more practical implementation 
            of what you will be learning in due course.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            <b>What skills do I need for Hackathon Uno?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
           Apart from access to the internet and a laptop? Just some focus and consistency in following the learning the 
            prerequisites for the actual Hacakthon
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What tools and resources should I be familiar with?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
          Kindly refer to the <a href="Roadmap-Prereq.html" > Roadmap/Prequisite page.</a>
        </p>


        <p>
            <b>What are the common challenges faced in hackathons?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
          You might find yourself yourself frustrated over deciding which model to implement. The notion of some models being
            'better' than others is totally wrong. There is no perfect one-fits-all best model out there. You need to, instead of
            simply trying different models in a long tedious trial and error process; study various concepts and usability of models
            to improve your error margins/accuracies.
        </p>


        <p>
            <b>How are hackathons judged?</b>  
        </p>
        <p> 
          The judging criteria will be explained on the hosting platform (Kaggle) when the Hackathon is officially hosted.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What happens after the hackathon?</b>  
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, you would have to wait until then, wouln' ya?
        </p>
        <p>
            But seriously, you will be drawn into this wonderful field and might wish to participate in more complicated hackathons
            And you are more than welcome to do so, if you think you can manage to. The organisers, however, are considering on conducting yet
            another hackathon after the first one. This hackathon will be way more complicated than the first one, but easier than real-life
            highly rewarding ones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on how much effective learning this hackathon stimulates, we shall conduct a tougher one later on.
