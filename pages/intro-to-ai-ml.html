        Human brain is a giant when it comes to compute power. It can do a few hundred to few thousand complicated functions without you noticing as much an itch. It can do this because evolution, over the eons, helped create patterns in the connections of hundreds of billions of neurons enabling us to perform complicated tasks with ease. The issue with the created patterns, however, is that our brains cannot be tuned for new tasks that evolution didn't deem worthy of energy expense. This is why it is hard for us to multiply two random 20 digit numbers, but easy to recognize roughly written numbers (as evolution prioritized symbol recognition over large arithmetic).

    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, a computer, even with just a small fraction of complexity as a Human brain, is fully tune-able. This enables us to do tasks that were prioritized less in our brain's circuitry, much faster. This is possible even with lower compute power compared to our brain, due to the immense flexibility of a computer. This is one primary reason why the use of computers is prevalent in almost every human task in the world we live in now.

Programming is a form of communicating with computers, helping them understand what is required from them at a particular instance. Thus, the forms are called Programming languages. Most computers in use today involve many different programs pre-written in the computer to make the interface usable without having to learn programming or/and reduce repetition. This layer of intuitive containerization in computers is called the user interface. It enables an user to perform certain common tasks without having to delve into communicate with the computer directly each time.

    </p>
    <p>
        This, however, hides a lot of complexity and power of computers from an average user. Everything from powering on your computer and displaying the starting animation, to opening a chrome tab and playing a YT video had it's own scripts and programs written by some smart SWE (Software Engineer), which then run at a click of a button to do the task you're asking it to do. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Each aspect of using computers involves utilizing it's compute power through programming, be that a program written by you, some SWE in seattle or by chatGPT. Traditional programming involves total control of what is to be done. All the things your computer does is hard-programmed, to be determined explicitly by the user through well-defined rules and instructions.

    </p>
    <p>
        While this is amazing in itself, there are some tasks that are too complex to be handled through explicit programming alone. For example, in order for a computer to recognize patterns through explicit programming alone would be an immensely difficult task, if at all a possible one. 

    </p>
    <p>
        It's very non-trivial to set a boundary of rules on recognizing patterns in massive datasets, predicting outcomes, or learning from experience - all things that humans do quite naturally. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in.

    </p>
<p>
        AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on building systems out of computers that are capable of performing tasks that typically require Human intelligence. Instead of writing explicit rules for every possible situation, AI systems are designed to learn from data and improve over time (Note: whilst defining AI systems and using them are a part of computer science; The working principles of AI systems are based on traditional math and physics based concepts). 

    </p>
    <p>
        AI systems are capable of doing many different tasks based on how they are defined. This includes tasks like understanding natural speech, recognizing cat images, making decisions, and even driving cars. But AI systems are not so widely used just because they can mimic certain Human decision-making. They are widely used because they can extrapolate Human decision-making to a level higher than any human. (For example, a human quality inspector can identify good quality from bad say 1-2 times a second. But for the same, an AI system can be set up to do it say 100-200 times a second, with similar or better accuracy).

    </p>
    <p>
        The power of AI lies in its ability to adapt, learn, and scale in ways that traditional programming and Human intelligence cannot.
