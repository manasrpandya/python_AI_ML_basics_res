        Human brain is a giant when it comes to compute power. It can do a few hundred to few thousand complicated functions without you noticing as much an itch. This is possible because evolution, over millions of years, has shaped the brain's neural connections, allowing us to perform complex tasks effortlessly. The issue with the created patterns, however, is that our brains cannot be tuned for new tasks that evolution didn't deem worthy of energy expense (at least not as fast as a computer can be tuned).
    </p> 
        <p>
    This is why it is hard for us to multiply two random 20 digit numbers, but easy to recognize roughly written numbers (as evolution prioritized symbol recognition over large arithmetic).

    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, a computer, even with just a small fraction of complexity as a Human brain, is fully tune-able. This enables us to do tasks that were prioritized less in our brain's circuitry, much faster. This is possible even with lower compute power compared to our brain, due to the immense flexibility of a computer. This is one primary reason why the use of computers is prevalent in almost every human task in the world we live in now.

<u>Programming</u> is a form of communicating with computers, helping them understand what is required from them at a particular instance. Thus, these forms are called Programming <i>languages</i>. Most computers in use today involve many different programs pre-written in the computer to make the interface usable without having to learn programming or/and reduce repetition. This layer of intuitive abstraction in computers is called the user interface. It enables an user to perform certain common tasks without having to delve into communicate with the computer directly each time.

    </p>
    <p>
        This, however, hides a lot of complexity and power of computers from an average user. Everything from powering on your computer and displaying the starting animation, to opening a chrome tab and playing a YT video had it's own scripts and programs written by some smart SWE (Software Engineer), which then run at a click of a button to do the task you're asking it to do. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Each aspect of using computers involves utilizing it's compute power through programming, be that a program written by you, some SWE in seattle or by chatGPT. Traditional programming involves total control of what is to be done. All the things your computer does is pre-programmed, to be determined explicitly by the user through well-defined rules and instructions.

    </p>
    <p>
        While this is amazing in itself, there are some tasks that are too complex to be handled through explicit programming alone. For instance, programming a computer to recognize patterns using explicit rules would be immensely difficult, if not impossible. 

    </p>
    <p>
        It's very non-trivial to set a boundary of rules on recognizing patterns in massive datasets, predicting outcomes, or learning from experience - all things that humans do quite naturally. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in.

    </p>
<p>
        <u>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</u> is a branch of computer science that focuses on building systems out of computers that are capable of performing tasks that typically require Human intelligence. Instead of writing explicit rules for every possible situation, AI systems are designed to learn from data and improve over time (Note: whilst defining AI systems and using them are a part of computer science; The working principles of AI systems are based on traditional math and physics based concepts). 

    </p>
    <p>
        AI systems are capable of doing many different tasks based on how they are defined. This includes tasks like understanding natural speech, recognizing cat images, making decisions, and even driving cars.
    </p> 
        
    <p>
        But AI systems are not so widely used just because they can mimic certain Human decision-making. They are widely used because they can extrapolate Human decision-making to a level higher than any human. (For example, a Human quality inspector can identify good quality from bad say 1-2 times a second. But for the same, an AI system can be set up to do it say 100-200 times a second, with similar or better accuracy).

    </p>
        <p>
            This isn't to say that AI is smarter than humans in generic intelligence. AI systems can replicate and sometimes outperform humans in specific, well-defined tasks by processing large volumes of data much faster than a human can. However, they are not <i>yet</i> capable of general human intelligence or true extrapolation of complex decision-making.
        </p>
        
    <p>
        The power of AI lies in its ability to adapt, learn, and scale in ways that traditional programming and Human intelligence cannot. That also means that learning how to define AI systems would not always be as intuitive as traditional programming. One would need him/herself to devote some amount of flexibility of intuition and learn new forms of logic in order to even try to understand gists of AI/ML. (For example Deep Learning: While we understand the underlying mechanisms of deep learning, the exact reasons behind some behaviors and decisions made by deep neural networks can be difficult to interpret, earning them the reputation of being 'black boxes.')
