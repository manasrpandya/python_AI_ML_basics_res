        <p>Welcome to Hackathon Uno! This is a challenge designed for students from ITTMZ to learn and explore AI/ML concepts from the ground up.
            This hackathon is divided into two:    
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1) The learning</b> (Present - 20th Nov) :-  This hackathon is worked out in the assumption that the participant is a complete beginner. 
            Having said that, before the actual commencement of the hackathon, the participant is advised to go through a few weeks of 
            somewhat intensive learning, wherein the participant is expected to dedicate some time daily to effective learning of the basics 
            required to participate in the hackathon. The directions that the participants may want to follow (instead of searching everything by themselves) are given in the below pages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>2)The hacking</b> (20th Nov - 1st Dec) :- Let the hacking begin! (more instructions will be updated soon)
        </p>
        <p>The following is a list of links (in the suggested order to read) to pages with resources to help in learning and getting into this field:</p> 
           <p> <a href="pages/intro-to-ai-ml.html style="color: dark blue";>Intro to AI/ML</a> - gives a first principle perspective of AI/ML. </p>
        <p> <a href="pages/some-basics.html" style="color: dark blue";> Answers to some basic questions</a> - helps the participant understand some basics: what is and why a hackathon? How does this help? (and others)</p>
